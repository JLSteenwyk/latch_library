### Mission

There are common snippets of code used across diverse workflows in the [LatchBio SDK](https://console.latch.bio/explore). This community-led encyclopedia aims to catalog common code snippets and save developer time. Please feel free to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)!

### Dockerfile snippets

#### Installing packages and software
- **Installing Miniconda**
  - Anaconda is an extremely useful open source package and environment management system
  - To install it from a Dockerfile, paste the instruction in the installing_conda.txt file inside your Dockerfile
  - The commands in the text execute the following tasks:
    - download and install miniconda in the indicated folder
    - add the conda binary to the $PATH
  - Conda can now be used normally (e.g conda install samtools)

#### Installing packages from pypi

- **Installing from PyPi**
  - Popular software used by bioinformaticians are distributed via PyPi and can easily be incorporated into LatchBio workflows.
  - To do so, create a `requirements.txt` that details the packages to download in the same directory as your `Dockerfile`. Next, add `COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt; RUN pip install -r requirements.txt` to your `Dockerfile`.

- **Download and compile software**
  - Software can be distributed in tar gzipped directories. The source code often needs to be compiled into binaries, which is often done by executing the command `make install`.
  - To handle these types of software in a `Dockerfile` for use in a Latch workflow, a series of commands can be strung together to automatically download and compile the workflow. The general steps are the same as when working in the terminal wherein the software is downloaded using something like `curl`, unzipped, and `make` commands are executed.

### I/O operations

#### Writing out stdout

- **capturing stdout**
    - bioinformaticians are frequently captured the stdout using the `>` character from one software to feed into another. Use this code snippet for writing the stdout to a file and returning the output.
    - [snippet](snippets/capturing_stdout.txt) | [example code](https://github.com/JLSteenwyk/latch_wf_codon_optimization)

- **handling multiple output files**
    - numerous software will generate multiple output files that have the same prefix
    - the best way to deal with this is by writing them all to a directory and then returning the resulting directory
